# labs

In Phase1, we’re going to build a simple API (with no code) to gain some clarity and visuals on proper route structure and the data contracts. We will use a product called ‘json-server’ to build a simple API server that fulfills all of our business requirements in a “sandbox”


For the first phase, our API will perform CRUD operations using ReST methods on 2 data models using json-server, an installable and configurable API application used to “spin up” servers for testing purposes. We will be using this to set the goal for our business requirements, and create working documentation.



#### How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)

-  `node index.js`
